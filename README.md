It's a set of repositories composing the kekule moodle set.

This set contains atto plugin editor and quizz moodle questions, with many new custom features made by myself like :

- Ability to set by default circle arround charge mark type for students or/and teachers.
- Ability to use by default element specified colors for students or/and teachers.
